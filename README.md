[![Update ROCK](https://github.com/canonical/prometheus-rock/actions/workflows/rock-update.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/canonical/prometheus-rock/actions/workflows/rock-update.yaml)

[ROCKs](https://canonical-rockcraft.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/) for [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/).  
This repository holds all the necessary files to build ROCKs for the upstream versions we support. The Prometheus ROCK is used by the [prometheus-k8s-operator](https://github.com/canonical/prometheus-k8s-operator) charm.

The ROCKs on this repository are built with [OCI Factory](https://github.com/canonical/oci-factory/), which also takes care of periodically rebuilding the images. We usually support our ROCKs for about six months from the release date.

Automation takes care of:
* validating PRs, by simply trying to build the ROCK;
* pulling upstream releases, creating a PR with the necessary files to be manually reviewed;
* releasing to GHCR at ghcr.io/canonical/prometheus:dev, when merging to main, for development purposes.
